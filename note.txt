1. What is WebRTC?
     . webRTC is a open-source project
     . Provide API for real-time communication

2. Uses?
     . Iot Devices, Robotics
     . Financial application
     . Communication application
     . Online education
     . Telemedicine
     . Collaboration solutions 
     . Gaming and entertainment

3. How WebRTC Comes? 
     . In May 2010, Google bought Global IP Solutions or GIPS, a VoIP and videoconferencing software company that had developed many components
     required for RTC, such as codecs and echo cancellation techniques.

     . In May 2011, Google released an open-source project for browser-based realt-time communication known as WebRTC

     . February 2013 WebRTC milestones include the first cross-browser video call

     . February 2014 first cross-browser data transfer

     . July 2014 Google Hangouts starting WebRTC


3.New terms ?
     
     WebRTC = Web Real-Time Communication
     P2P = Peer to Peer
     SDP = Session Description Protocol
     ICE = Interactivity Connection Establishment
     RTP = Real Time Protocol
     STUN = Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
     NAT = Network adress translator


4. How WebRTC works --> Same Network 
        . Direct P2P Socket Connection 
             (jodi same network e thake tahole P2P Connection possible)
        . Relayed Media
            (ei P2P er maddome media er adhan pordhan hobe ekjon r ekjon information media shob kichu share kora jabe)


5. How WebRTC works --> Different Network
         . STUN SERVER Connection 
            (different network jokon 2jon user thakche tokon first connection established korar jonno alada ekta server proyjon hocche sei server ta ke bolchi amra stun server )

            STUN SERVER er maddome 2 different network er bitor connection estblished hobe 


            connection estblished howar por direct amader ke data adan prodhan korte hobe but sei khtere direct data trnasmit home sei jonno amader ke onno r ekti server er proyjon hobe TURN SERVER

           .TURN SERVER Relayed Media
